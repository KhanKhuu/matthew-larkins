#### FoodSelect 

An app that helps users avoid toxic additives in food using their phone cameras and ingredients lists or UPC codes on food packages.


#### FoodSelect.io

Landing page for the FoodSelect app

#### PiTank

A raspberry pi-powered rover with an iOS app that wife and I can use to drive around our home and view the video stream

#### EyeSaver

One of the earliest projects using the OpenCV AIKit (OAK) module. Uses the OAK camera to estimate a users gaze and determine whether they are looking at their computer screen or not, sending an alert if they have been looking for too long and need to take a break.

#### PMRF-D

Research project with Dr. Talita Perciano at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. This project adapts the MPI-PMRF framework to the task of denoising large images, e.g. material sample images from beamline 8.3.2 at the Advanced Light Source user facility at Berkeley Lab.
